            Hello, I am Gabriel from Quito, Ecuador, passionate about soccer, adventure, and
            discovering new places.I enjoy learning about diverse topics and have a natural
            curiosity for how things work.
            Problem-solving and fixing challenges,whether at work or in daily life, keep me
            motivated and engaged.
            I value meaningful conversations over small talk and bring a proactive, energetic
            mindset to everything I do.

        <h2>Quito</h2>
        <img src="images/quito.jpg" alt="Quito landscape">
        <p> Quito, Ecuador's capital, is a city that feels both historic and alive. Nestled high in
            the Andes, it charms visitors with its colonial Old Town full of plazas, churches, and
            cobblestone streets.
            At the same time, modern neighborhoods buzz with cafes, museums, and local markets. The
            city is framed by stunning volcanoes like Cotopaxi and Pichincha, giving it a dramatic
            backdrop. From El Panecillo's hilltop views to the famous Middle of the World monument,
            Quito blends culture, adventure, and breathtaking scenery.</p>
